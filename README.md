# Disaster-management-using-IOT-ML-SOLUTION
IoT-ML solution to prevent the aftermath of disaster by automating water supply to the shelter homes without network and electricity by using Arduino and NRF modules.  Supply appropriate quantity of food and medicines as needed using lora modules overcoming the problem of no network and electricity. Predict days of food and electricity shortage using ML algorithm such as random forest and normalise it using lasso regression.
